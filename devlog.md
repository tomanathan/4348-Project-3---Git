Today, in this entry, I am atarting this project. I can recognize that it is due tomorrow, but to be honest just didnt have time because of way too many finals, so this is how its going to be.

the plan first of all is to set up the git structure and start on a basic start to the project overall

my understanding of the project right now is that I need to create software to create, read, and edit these index files containing b trees, and also to implement a search and load. 
im going to commit this log, then begin work on just getting a rough idea of the structure of these b trees, and try to decode the sample.idx file so I can tell what's happening.

i've been studying for my finals all day, but its time to get started on this. I've been thinking about this project all day, and i now have an idea on how im going to start implementing it. this session, im going to set up the BTreeNode class, which should have methods to serialize and deserialize, while sticking to the structure required for this.

just finished the implementation i was going to do before, it wasnt very hard. i was mostly just trying to take the parameters tying the entire thing together from the instructions and putting it into code. I didnt really have problems, and im going to take a 5 minute break before starting to code again. nothing really happened, we are just beginning, so i accomplished everything i wanted to get done! next, i want to read the header of the index file, so thats going to be the next part of my implementation

ok its time for me to start coding again. going back to what i was expecting to do before, i want to write some code to read the headers. that's about it honestly, i havent had much time to think in between the last session and this one, but this is a pretty boring, simple next step so just time to do it i guess.
