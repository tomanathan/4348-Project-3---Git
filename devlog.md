### Log Entry 1

Today, in this entry, I am atarting this project. I can recognize that it is due tomorrow, but to be honest just didnt have time because of way too many finals, so this is how its going to be.

the plan first of all is to set up the git structure and start on a basic start to the project overall

my understanding of the project right now is that I need to create software to create, read, and edit these index files containing b trees, and also to implement a search and load. 
im going to commit this log, then begin work on just getting a rough idea of the structure of these b trees, and try to decode the sample.idx file so I can tell what's happening.
